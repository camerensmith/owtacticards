# AI Advanced Strategies - Session 4

## 🎯 Dynamic Gameplay Modes

### 1. ✅ Resource Denial Strategy

**Problem:** AI didn't prioritize disrupting enemy combos

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Synergy engine detection:** Identifies Lucio, Mercy, Zenyatta, Torbjorn, Orisa, Baptiste, Brigitte
- **Combo prevention:** +50 bonus when synergy engine paired with damage dealers
- **Resource denial:** +30 bonus for synergy engines, +45 for high synergy cards

**Strategic Impact:**
```
Enemy Board: Lucio (synergy 3) + Pharah (power 5)
Old AI: Targets Pharah (highest power)
New AI: Targets Lucio (+50 combo prevention) → Denies enemy ultimate setup!
```

**Files Modified:**
- `threatAssessment.js` - Enhanced synergy threat detection (lines 82-109)

### 2. ✅ Desperation Mode (Score < -25)

**Problem:** AI played defensively when losing badly

**Solution Implemented:**

**Triggers When:** Board score < -25 (losing badly)

**Behavior Changes:**
- ⚠️ Ignore all card holds → Play everything
- ⚠️ Switch to SYNERGY_BURST strategy → Go for big plays

```
Board Score: -27 (losing badly)
Hand: [Pharah (held), Ana, Mercy]

Normal AI:
- Holds Pharah for synergy
- Plays Ana

Desperation AI:
⚠️ DESPERATION MODE ACTIVATED
- Plays Pharah immediately (+0.6 power bonus)
- Plays Ana (+0.4 ability bonus)
- Goes all-in for comeback!
```

**Files Modified:**
- `AIController.js` - Desperation detection and bonuses (lines 836-853, 943-971)

### 3. ✅ Victory Push Mode (Score > 25)

  - High power (5+): +0.7 multiplier
  - Damage dealers: +0.5 multiplier
  - Medium power (3+): +0.4 multiplier
  - Damage abilities: +0.35 multiplier
  - Weak supports: -0.5 penalty (not needed)

**Example:**
```
Board Score: +28 (crushing victory)
Hand: [Soldier, Reinhardt, Zenyatta]

Normal AI:
- Defensive play
- Holds Reinhardt
- Slow win

Victory Push AI:
🏆 VICTORY PUSH ACTIVATED
- Plays Soldier (+0.7 power, +0.5 damage role)
- Plays Reinhardt (+0.4 medium power)
- Holds Zenyatta (-0.5 weak support)
- Finishes game quickly!
