# AI System Improvements Summary

## 🎯 Session Goal
Fix AI targeting issues and improve strategic decision-making for the Overwatch Card Game AI opponent.

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Modal Choice AI Context Restoration ✅
**Problem:** AI-controlled heroes requiring player input for targeting during AI turn
- Enemy Ashe was prompting player to select targets
- Modal dialog delays caused AI context flags to clear before callbacks executed
- Affected all heroes with onEnter ability choices

**Solution:**
- Created `aiContextHelper.js` with `withAIContext()` wrapper function
- Wrapper restores AI flags before executing modal callbacks
- Applied to all 9 heroes with modal choices:
  - Ashe (damage vs split fire)
  - Mercy (heal vs damage boost)
  - Baptiste (damage column vs heal column)
  - Tracer (single vs dual pistols)
  - Zenyatta (Harmony vs Discord)
  - Brigitte (damage vs repair pack)
  - Bastion (damage vs token)
  - Lucio (shuffle vs healing)
  - Reaper (single vs split)

**Files Modified:**
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/engine/aiContextHelper.js` (NEW)
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/ashe.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/mercy.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/baptiste.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/tracer.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/zenyatta.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/brigitte.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/bastion.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/lucio.js`
- `owcardgame/src/abilities/heroes/reaper.js`

### 2. Deterministic RNG Implementation ✅
**Problem:** Non-reproducible AI behavior due to Math.random() usage
- Made debugging impossible
- Couldn't reproduce AI decisions
- Testing was non-deterministic

**Solution:**
- Replaced all `Math.random()` calls with `this.rng.next()` (seeded RNG)
- Updated tacticalPlanner.js to accept RNG parameter
- All randomness now uses SeededRNG for reproducibility

**Changes:**
- `owcardgame/src/ai/AIGameIntegration.js`: 8 replacements
- `owcardgame/src/ai/tacticalPlanner.js`: Added RNG parameter, 4 replacements
- `owcardgame/src/ai/AIController.js`: Updated to pass RNG to tactical planner

### 3. Turn Economy Enforcement ✅
**Problem:** AI could play unlimited cards per turn
- No enforcement of game rules
- Could violate turn limits

**Solution:**
- Added `cardsPlayedThisTurn` counter
- Added `MAX_CARDS_PER_TURN = 3` constant
- Enforced limit in `executePlayCard()` method
- Counter reset at turn start

**Files Modified:**
- `owcardgame/src/ai/AIGameIntegration.js` (lines 21-23, 61-62, 162-165, 317-318)

### 4. Row Hazard & Buff Awareness ✅
**Problem:** AI ignored row effects when placing cards
- No avoidance of debuffs (Hanzo token, Widowmaker sight)
- Didn't leverage buffs (Orisa barrier, Lucio heal)
- Overstacked in same row (AOE vulnerability)

**Solution:**
- Added hazard/buff detection in `evaluateRowFit()`
- Penalties: Overstacking -30, Hanzo token -20, Widow sight -15, BOB token -25
- Bonuses: Orisa barrier +25, Lucio heal +15, Orisa supercharger +20

**Files Modified:**
- `owcardgame/src/ai/positioningIntelligence.js` (lines 67, 79-123)

### 5. Threat Assessment System ✅
**Problem:** Poor target prioritization
- No understanding of threat levels
- Weak ally protection logic

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive threat assessment module
- Scores enemies by: Role (Support+100, Damage+70, Tank+40), Power×8, Synergy, Health
- Special hero bonuses: Mercy+60, Ana+45, Pharah+55
- Kill priority system: Highest threat + easy kill opportunities
- Ally protection: Critical health+100, Low health+60, Support+80

**Files Modified:**
- `owcardgame/src/ai/threatAssessment.js` (NEW)
- `owcardgame/src/ai/AIGameIntegration.js` (integrated threat-based targeting)

## 📊 AI Decision Intelligence

### Modal Choice Evaluation
The AI evaluates each choice option by scoring:
- **Damage abilities:** Base score + damage amount×10, bonus if enemies have high health
- **Healing abilities:** Base score + heal amount×8, bonus if allies wounded
- **AOE effects:** +20 base, +25 if many enemies present
- **Buffs:** +25 base, +15 if strong board presence
- **Summons:** +30 base, +15 if board space available

### Difficulty-Based Selection
- **Easy (40% optimal):** 40% best choice, 60% random
- **Medium (70% optimal):** 70% best, 20% second best, 10% random
- **Hard (90% optimal):** 90% best, 8% second best, 2% random

### Win Condition Planning
AI adapts strategy based on hand and board:
- **Power Dominance:** High power cards, tanks
- **Synergy Burst:** Build synergy for ultimates
- **Tempo Control:** Removal and board control
- **Attrition:** Healers and sustained value
- **Combo Setup:** Specific card combinations

## 🎮 Special Systems

### Ultimate Management
- Mercy resurrection with target prioritization (Offense+50, Support+35, Power×5)
- Zarya ultimate timing (waits for high threat or good setup)
- Barrier toggles (Reinhardt/Winston based on enemy threat level)

### Special Card Auto-Play
- BOB, D.Va MEKA, Torbjorn Turret played immediately after ultimates
- D.Va return detection and immediate MEKA replay
- Prevents card expiration waste

### Symmetra AI Logic
- **Enemy targeting:** Power×15, Health×8, Tank+30, Support+25
- **Ally targeting:** Critical(1HP)+100, Low health+50, Debuffs+40
- Only teleports if score > 0
